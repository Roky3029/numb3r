### NUMB3R 🎲

Numb3r is a project developed with the intention to be an useful tool in order for people to handle the reasonment process and Numb3r the computations.

The vast majority of algorithms used in this project are my own implementations, and, although it may not be the most efficient algorithm, it does the work pretty well.

#### Tech stack 💻

This project uses a very basic frontend stack:

- ReactJS: The main library for building the app.
- NextJS: Although it is mainly centered on Server Side, I decided to use it because of the facilities it gives when handling routes
- TailwindCSS: For the main styles of the application
